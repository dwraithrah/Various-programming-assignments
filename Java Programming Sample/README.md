# What this is
This project is the culmination of one of my programming courses using Java.  It is a basic inventory tracking program that allows a user to view inventory for various products in different stores.  This project was created and tested using NetBeans. The .java files can be viewed using notepad and they are the source code for this program. 

## The java files

This is the 'main' program. It runs the Jackson_StoreInventoryDemo class.

# What is this lab?
This lab was an introduction to drawing basic graphics on an html page using Javascript and WebGL (primarily javascript).  We drew a pixelated version of Scarecrow from the Batman comics.  

## Contents:

### Scarecrow.jpg.  
This artpiece was taken from the internet and it is the reference we used when creating our scarecrow.

### Scarecrow.html

This is the file you can click on to open an html page displaying the work. Best viewed in an updated version of Chrome.

### Scarecrow_Files
Various files that make up the scarecrow program.  Scarecrow.js is the main file. The first half (top half of the scarecrow body) was 
coded by myself.  
The second half (bottom half of the body) was coded by my partner, Eloy Perez. 

The other files were provided by the instructor to be modified as needed.  In this case we did not need to modify these files.

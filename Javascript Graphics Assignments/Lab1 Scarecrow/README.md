# What is this lab?
This lab was an introduction to drawing basic graphics on an html page using Javascript and WebGL (primarily javascript).  We drew a pixelated version of Scarecrow from the Batman comics.  

## Contents:

### Scarecrow.jpg.  
This artpiece was taken from the internet and it is the reference we used when creating our scarecrow.

### Scarecrow.html

This is the file you can click on to open an html page displaying the work. Best viewed in an updated version of Chrome.

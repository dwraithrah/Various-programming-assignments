# What this is:
This is sample code in C++ for a project I did in my intro to robotics class.  My part of the three part project was to use the A* algorithm to program a path that a robot could take in a gridded room given obstacles.  The program was to take the robot around the obstacles and to the end of the room in the quickest way possible.

### AStarWriteup.docx:
This document explains how the program works and what the output means.  To summarize, the robot moves in 8 cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, etc..), and the output depicts it's path.  1 = starting position. 0 = grid spaces not taken. 3 = path taken. 7 = obstacles. 9 = destination.  Follow the 3's to see the quickest path calculated by the program.

This is a screenshot of the output created by the program. 

### SourceCode.txt:
This is my code, readable using a text editor or notepad.  It was put together after reading various tutorials on the A* algorithm using C++.  It was created, tested and run in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

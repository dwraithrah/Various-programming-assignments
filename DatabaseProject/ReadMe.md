# Database Project
## What this is:
This is my class project for the database course I took. The objective was to create the back end of a simple relational database that held 
content of our choosing. In this case I chose to create a database that holds information for theoretical service that allows video game
enthusiasts and developers to share, comment and rate video games. 
## Project Contents:

### Final Database Report:
A word document that explains the purpose and design of the database.  It has diagrams detailing the relational model of the various components of the database and the design of the various queries.

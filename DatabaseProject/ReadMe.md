# Database Project
## What this is:
This is my class project for the database course I took. The objective was to create the back end of a simple relational database that held content of our choosing. In this case I chose to create a database that holds information for theoretical service that allows video game enthusiasts and developers to share, comment and rate video games.  I have posted this project to show how I designed a relational database via the document report and to show how I created the various queries via the uploaded SQL code. 

## Project Contents:

### Final Database Report .docx:
A word document that explains the purpose and design of the database.  It has diagrams detailing the relational model of the various components of the database and the design of the various queries. 

### Video Game Stored Procedures .zip file:
This contains all of the sql queries created for this project. They are readable using notepad or microsoft sql server.

### Video Game Stored Procedures folder:
This contains all of the sql queries so that they can be individually downloaded and viewed without downloading all of them via the .zip folder. 

## How to view this content:

The .docx files need to be viewed in Microsoft word to be able to see the documents and the diagrams.  They can be viewed using Microsoft Viewer as well.  Notepad can be used to view the text but the images might not be viewed.  

The SQL code can be looked at using notepad. They were created using Microsoft SQL server 2016.  They were tested creating a test database on Microsoft SQL server using the relational model detailed in the Final Database Report.  Sadly the test database was lost due to data corruption.
